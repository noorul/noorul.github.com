title: My IBM ThinkPad R52 completed six years.
---
<p>
I am not sure whether the title is a good one for blog entry. But I
just wanted to write about my laptop which served me for more than 6
years and still alive and kicking.
</p>

<p>
Ever since I started using computers, it was my dream to own one. But
during school days I could not realize the same because I was not
earning and also my father could not afford it. I was desperate to get
one when I was in college but met with same fate. I got job through on
campus recruitment, after finishing my course I joined the company and
within an year I bought my first computer, it was <a href="http://www.thinkpad.com">IBM ThinkPad</a> R52.
Now IBM no longer manufactures laptops and is owned by Lenovo.
</p>

<p>
Exactly on July 7th, 2005, I bought this machine on which I am typing
now. At that time, I paid a very high price for the below mentioned
configuration. At times I feel bad that I paid around Rs. 65K for this
configuration.

As you could see it was just having 256 MB RAM. Midway in 2006, I
added 512MB more when I was in U.S.A.
</p>

<p>
Initially it came with WinXP Pro loaded but with 256 MB RAM, the OS
was running too slow. The response was not great. In college days, I
used <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>, so straight away I installed an early version of Debian
on that and configured Enlightenment window manager. The response was
really great. I never looked back to Windows. Now it runs Debian
Squeeze (aka 6.0) along with <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org">Enlightenment</a> DR17 as window manager.
</p>

<p>
I use this laptop for all my computer works, no matter what,
developing software, watching movies, browsing, manipulating video
files, editing images, you name it.
</p>

<p>
This laptop travelled a lot in India and several times to U.S.A. I
carried this on local bus, train, flight and also on ship to
<a href="http://lakshadweep.nic.in">Lakshdweep</a>. I admire the ThinkPad build quality from IBM. I only had
one issue with LCD couple of times. Once in warranty, other when it
was out of warranty.
</p>

<p>
I hope this lovely piece of device will keep on serving me. No matter
what may come, I will not be giving it away. This may end up as an
antique. I don't know but I love it a lot.
