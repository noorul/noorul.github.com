title: Debian Squeeze (aka 6.0) on IBM ThinkPad R52.
---
<p>
Installing the latest version of Debian ThinkPad R52 was not as
straight forward as I thought. I had only one issue and this blog post
talks about that. Since I manually solved this problem, I hope a blog
post might be useful for others.
</p>

<p>
The problem occurs while detecting "Network devices". The installer is
unable to proceed because the process (ethdetect) which detects all
network devices never returns control to the installer. Since IBM
ThinkPad R52 comes with Intel wireless chip, the driver needs firmware
which are not part of Debian official release.

<pre class="example">
noorul@laptop:~$ lspci | grep Wireless
04:02.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 2200BG [Calexico2] Network Connection (rev 05)
</pre>

<p>
The installer keeps on looking for this firmware in /dev/fd0 (i.e
floppy disk) which my machine don't have and it loops. See below.

</pre>

<p>
As a solution, I choose "expert mode" installation and before setting
Network devices, I switched over to another virtual terminal (Alt-F2)
and got a shell. I ran "ethdetect" command there so that this runs as
a separate process independent of the installer. This step will not
block the installer and you can continue with setting up network from
the menu skipping detecting network devices.
