title: BSNL broadband and FUP mess
---
<p>
I have been using BSNL broadband connection for around 4 years.
Recently they introduced FUP (Fair Usage Policy). As per this policy
every month, I get to use 6 GB of data at 1 Mbps speed and after that,
the speed drops to 512 kps. Today, being 1st of the month, I supposed
to get 1 Mbps, but I was only getting 512 Kbps. This is because I
rarely switch off my modem/router. I had to reboot it to fix it.
