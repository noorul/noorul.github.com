title: Reliance ZTE AC2738 USB modem on Debian Wheezy
---
<p>
Recently my old Reliance NetConnect+ USB modem stopped working because of
hardware issue. The old one is made by HUAWEI and worked out of the box on
Debian Wheezy. The new one that I bought as a replacement is ZTE model AC2738
and refused to work out of the box. I did the following to make it work.
</p>

<p>
Created new file /etc/udev/rules.d/90-zte.rules and added the following.
</p>

<pre class="example">
SUBSYSTEM=="block", SUBSYSTEMS=="scsi", ATTRS{model}=="USB Storage FFE9", ACTION=="add", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe usbserial vendor=0x19d2 product=0xffe9"
</pre>

<p>
How did I arrive at that solution?
</p>

<p>
There is no readily available driver for this modem in linux. So, when this
device is plugged in, usb-storage module is loaded by default. Since usbserial
kernel module is compatible with most of the USB modems, I tried loading this
manually using following command.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">/sbin/modprobe usbserial <span style="color: #268bd2;">vendor</span>=0x19d2 <span style="color: #268bd2;">product</span>=0xffe9
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Vendor and Product id can be obtained using the <code>lsmod</code> command. The above
command successfully recognized the modem and I was able to use <code>wvdialconf</code> to
detect the modem.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to automate this so that this is loaded every time machine
boots. For this I added a <a href="http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html">udev rule</a> that I mentioned above. In order to figure
out which unique match keys is to be used, the following command helped.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">udevadm info --name=/dev/sdb --attribute-walk
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The device name may change with respect to your system. I used <code>dmesg</code> command
to figure that out.
</p>

<p>
The fun part is that, the effort that I put up for figuring this out was useful
for another member of <a href="http://ilugc.in">ILUGC</a>. The entire discussion thread is <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc/82199">here</a>.
