title: Apple Warranty Support â€“ Win!
---
<p>
Last July I bought an iPod touch from U.S through one of my
colleagues. Recently the home button stopped working. I took it to
Reliance Digital iStore, Chennai for servicing. Since the device is
still under warranty they said, they will replace the whole unit. They
said I will be able to collect the new one after 5 working days. And
after 5 days it happened. I went and collected a new iPod and I
restored my old iPod settings to the new one. Win!
