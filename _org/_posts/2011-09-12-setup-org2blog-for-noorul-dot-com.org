[[http://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][org2blog]] is written by [[http://github.com/punchagan][Puneeth Chaganti]]. It is an emacs extension to
post org mode sub trees as wordpress blog entries. In order to set
this up clone the repository from github.

#+begin_src sh
# clone org2blog git repository
git clone http://github.com/punchagan/org2blog.git
#+end_src

Add the following snippet to ~/.emacs

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/site-lisp/org2blog")
(require 'org2blog-autoloads)

(setq org2blog/wp-blog-alist
       '(("noorul.com"
          :url "http://noorul.com/blog/xmlrpc.php"
          :username "admin"
          :tags-as-categories t)))
(org2blog/wp-login)
#+end_src

Then I can go to the entry and call M-x org2blog/wp-post-subtree to
post a draft or C-u M-x org2blog/wp-post-subtree to publish it.
