I started this blog to learn writing and communicate with outside
world. Also to make my presence on the web felt. But I am not updating
this blog regularly which is very bad.

I am a person who admires [[http://sachachua.com][Sacha Chua]] in this particular skill. I have
been following her blog ever since she started blogging using
emacs-muse and planner (both of them are major modes of Emacs). Over
the time I could see a change in her style of writing and look and
feel of her blog. She has evolved and I like this evolution. I could
learn one thing from this, start small and things will fall in place.

Recently I contacted her to become my mentor. She agreed to do the
same. I hope with lots of tips and guidance from her, I can make this
blog active. The very first thing she told me is that I should write
first and forget about style, English and look and feel which will
become better as time progress. So this is my first post towards new
beginning. Thank you Sacha!
